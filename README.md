# My First Project using just JavaScript.#

## About the Project ##
To use the code you will need to have Node to run the code and a text editor such as VS Code.
What this code does is it uses an array to hold text that will be used in displayed messages when run and an empty array that will hold the message. To display the message a loop
is used to iterate through the array, and concatenate of the array strings randomly to a message it will then push it to the empty array where it is stored and then printed when the code is run.

## Why I made this? ##
* I made this small project to challenge myself by generating small messages by incorprating functions, arrays and loops.
